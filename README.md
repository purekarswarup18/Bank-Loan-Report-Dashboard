# Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard

ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
This Power BI dashboard project aims to help banks assess the overall performance of their loan portfolio. By analyzing key metrics such as loan application trends, funded vs. received amounts, good vs. bad loans, interest rates, and borrower profiles, financial institutions can make data-driven decisions and improve lending strategies.

The goal is to:

Track loan distribution over time, across regions, and among customer demographics.

Compare good vs. bad loans in terms of volume, funding, and repayments.

Understand the effect of employment length, loan purpose, and home ownership on loan outcomes.
